Just built a sleek Stopwatch App using Vanilla JavaScript!
This project gave me hands-on experience with time-based functions and DOM manipulation â€” all without any external libraries.

Features include:

Start, Pause, and Reset functionality 

Lap time tracking 

Real-time millisecond updates 

Fully responsive design with smooth UI/UX 

This app is ideal for learning how JavaScript handles intervals, time formatting, and interactive UI elements. Proud to keep pushing my front-end development skills forward!
